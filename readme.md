# Power Grapher

A simple Python tool to plot power functions of the form `y = a * x^n`.

## Features
- Plot power functions with user-defined `a` and `n`
- Save plots as PNG images
- Logs actions to `grapher.log`

## Usage
```bash
python grapher.py
Then enter values for a and n.

## Example

Input: a=2, n=3

Output: graph of y = 2x^3 and saved image power_function.png

## Future Plans

Add GUI or web interface

Plot multiple functions together
