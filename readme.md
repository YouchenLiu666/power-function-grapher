# Power Grapher

A simple Python tool to plot power functions of the form `y = a * x^n`.

## Features
- Plot power functions with user-defined `a` and `n`
- Save plots as PNG images
- Logs actions to `grapher.log`

## Usage
```bash
python grapher.py
```
Then enter values for `a` and `n` when prompted.

## Example
Input:
```
a = 2
n = 3
```
Output: Graph of `y = 2x^3` and saved image `power_plot.png`.

## Future Plans
- Add GUI or web interface
- Plot multiple functions together
